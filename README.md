### 1. Introduction

The healthcare sector is increasingly reliant on data to drive decision-making and improve patient outcomes. This report presents an analytical review of a hospital’s patient, appointment, and billing data, with the aim of identifying operational trends and areas for improvement. The dataset includes patient demographics, appointment details, treatment types, financial transactions, and hospital branch data.
As a data analyst, the purpose of this report is to derive meaningful insights from the data to support hospital administration in enhancing resource allocation, reducing inefficiencies, and improving service delivery across departments.

### 2. Methodology
The analysis was conducted using a cleaned and structured dataset extracted from the hospital’s records. The dataset includes fields such as patient demographics, appointment details, treatment types, billing amounts, payment methods, and hospital branch data.
#### Steps :

1. Data Cleaning: Duplicate records were reviewed, dates were standardized and age ranges were confirmed.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics, frequency distributions, and data groupings were generated.
3. Segmentation: Data was segmented by age group, department, branch, and appointment status.
4. Trend & Correlation Analysis: Patterns were identified using cross-tabulations.
5. Visualization: Graphs and charts were created to present key findings for interpretation.

### Data Analysis
Include some interesting code 

```sql
 
SELECT 
    a.patient_id,
    a.doctor_id,
    a.appointment_date,
    a.status,
    a.reason_for_visit,

    b.amount,
    b.payment_status,
    b.payment_method,
   

    t.treatment_type,
    t.description,

    
    d.specialization,
    d.hospital_branch,

    
    p.gender,
    p.insurance_provider,
    p.date_of_birth

FROM patients p
inner JOIN appointments a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
inner JOIN doctors d ON a.doctor_id = d.doctor_id
inner JOIN treatments t ON a.appointment_id = t.appointment_id
inner JOIN billing b ON p.patient_id = b.patient_id AND t.treatment_id = b.treatment_id;
 ```

### 3. Key Findings
#### 3.1 Patient Demographics
- The majority of patients (81) fall within the 30 to 49 age range.
- The least represented age group is 70 or Older, with only 21 patients.

#### 3.2 Appointment Status
- The most common status is 'No-show' with 52 instances.
- Followed by Scheduled (51), Cancelled (51), and Completed (46).
- This highlights a concern with missed appointments affecting service delivery.

#### 3.3 Payment Status
- Pending payments are the most common (69 cases).
- Failed payments total 67, while 64 have been successfully paid.
- This indicates potential issues with payment collection processes.

#### 3.4 Hospital Branch Activity
- Central Hospital is the busiest branch with 84 cases.
- Eastside Clinic follows with 62, and Westside Clinic with 54.
- This could inform decisions on resource distribution and staffing.

#### 3.5 Specialization Demand
- Pediatrics is the most in-demand department with 98 visits.
- Dermatology has 70, followed by Oncology with 32.

#### 3.6 Treatment Costs
- Chemotherapy generated the highest revenue (£128,856).
- Followed by MRI (£116,098) and X-Ray (£110,654).
- Physiotherapy and ECG also contributed significantly.

### 4. Conclusion
The analysis of the hospital’s dataset reveals key insights into patient demographics, appointment behaviors, financial trends, and departmental performance. The majority of patients are within the 30–49 age range, and Pediatrics stands out as the most visited specialization. However, operational inefficiencies are evident, particularly in the high number of missed appointments (no-shows and cancellations) and the volume of unpaid or failed transactions.

Central Hospital handles the largest patient volume, suggesting it may require additional resource support compared to other branches. Moreover, revenue is largely driven by a few high-cost treatments such as Chemotherapy and MRI, which are crucial areas for financial planning.

These findings emphasize the need for improved scheduling, payment recovery strategies, and balanced distribution of hospital resources to ensure efficiency and sustainability in service delivery.

### 5. Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are suggested:

#### Appointment Management
- Implement reminder systems (SMS/email) to reduce no-shows.
- Introduce online cancellation or rescheduling options to manage appointments more efficiently.
- Monitor doctors or departments with frequent cancellations to assess patient satisfaction or accessibility.

#### Payment and Billing Improvements
- Introduce automated billing reminders for pending payments.
- Offer multiple payment methods or payment plans to reduce failure rates.
- Analyze payment issues by age or insurance provider to tailor solutions.

#### Resource and Staff Allocation
- Reallocate staff and equipment to Central Hospital, which handles the highest patient load.
- Consider expanding Pediatric services, given high patient traffic in that department.

#### Operational Monitoring
- Develop a dashboard to track KPIs like appointment status, revenue, and payment collection in real time.
- Regularly review branch performance to ensure equitable distribution of workload and services.

#### Further Analysis
- Conduct deeper analysis into the causes of failed payments and no-show trends by time, treatment type, or demographic.
- Perform patient satisfaction surveys to identify service gaps that lead to missed appointments.
