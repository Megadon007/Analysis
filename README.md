# Hospital Management Data Analysis Report
### 1. Introduction

The healthcare sector is increasingly reliant on data to drive decision-making and improve patient outcomes. This report presents an analytical review of a hospital’s patient, appointment, and billing data, with the aim of identifying operational trends and areas for improvement. The dataset includes patient demographics, appointment details, treatment types, financial transactions, and hospital branch data.
As a data analyst, the purpose of this report is to derive meaningful insights from the data to support hospital administration in enhancing resource allocation, reducing inefficiencies, and improving service delivery across departments.

### 2. Methodology
The analysis was conducted using a cleaned and structured dataset extracted from the hospital’s records. The dataset includes fields such as patient demographics, appointment details, treatment types, billing amounts, payment methods, and hospital branch data.
#### Steps :

1. Data Cleaning: Duplicate records were reviewed, dates were standardized and age ranges were confirmed.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics, frequency distributions, and data groupings were generated.
3. Segmentation: Data was segmented by age group, department, branch, and appointment status.
4. Trend & Correlation Analysis: Patterns were identified using cross-tabulations.
5. Visualization: Graphs and charts were created to present key findings for interpretation.
